### Stand

Stand with information about project and several examples.
Also there are URL and QR code with URL.


### Special computer (museum terminal) with:

– projector or/and big monitor (or monitors, depends on size of room)
– Chrome App background running on it -> sends request every several seconds to server - if new images are ready --> automatically displays it on big monitor with signature (user name). Several visitors in this room may display their images at the same time.
– Browser running on it with standard "Inspiration" interface.

Visitors may enter their login-password on this terminal or their personal devices (notebook, mobile phone, etc.).
The second way – they need open browser (if use flickr) or install app (instagram).
They can input URL from keyboard or QR code, which are presented on the stand in the room.

**Resume:**
Visitors just enter into museum room and see stand about project. They enter their login-password (no matter – terminal or personal device) and see on big screen new vision of her/his life, full of colors, and how it correlates with color palette of chosen Painter.
 
To create new image they may use web interface (on terminal or own device)  for changing :
– type of visualization (square, circle, diagrams, etc.)
– source of colors (photos from concrete album or life period)
– Painter for comparing with
